# ToDo
Manage your ToDos by Github Issues and Projects


## Preparation

1. Clone this repo to your private repo (you can test it in public repo)
2. Edit ``.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/config.yml`` for your username and repository name to link custom.md as an actual template.
3. Create a projects in Projects like ``MyToDo`` with ``Automated Kanban`` type.
4. Try to create a new issue in Issues. Here is a new cool ToDo style form using custom.md. ([see official GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository))
5. Set automation in Project to handle closing issues.
6. Now you don't need any more extra to-do management apps!
